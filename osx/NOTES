Internal Development Notes
==========================
GUI sometimes blank. Sometimes crashes:

-top view accidentally of the NSCustomView class instead of NSView


Spawning error "no such file to load -- libyaml (LoadError)" on
deploy of embedded app

- rubygems are probaby required somewhere. They shouldn't(?) in
  an embedded app



Continuous error messages on spawn. Just added a new controller
to the top level.

- forgotten to select nib file in the object



New design...
-------------
Because of me misunderstanding the KVC procedures of Cocoa,
a new design is wanted...

InstrumentsController (File's Owner)
  |
Instruments.xib - configuration.rb
  |
 NSArrayController.contentArray.bind to (InstrumentsController.configuration.instruments) 



InstrumentController (File's Owner)
  |
Instrument.xib - InstrumentsController
  |
 NSButton.value.bind to (InstrumentsController.selected(self))
